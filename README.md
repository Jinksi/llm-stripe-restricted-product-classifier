An agentic LLM system for determining whether specific products are restricted from sale by Stripe.

For OpenAI, Anthropic, etc, add API keys to `.env`.

Using [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) for local examples â€“ ensure a model is loaded and exposed to `localhost:1234`.

`npm run eval` to run model evaluation.

`npm run eval:dev` to run model evaluation in watch mode (watch that API usage!)
